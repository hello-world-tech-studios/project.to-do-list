# To Do List
Whats the best way to organize everything you need to get done in a day, or for a specific task? Make a to do list! (Seriously. You should make daily to do lists. Productivity goes up exponentially. Especially if you're prone to procrastination.) Why not make one you can use online?

## Objective

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Optional:
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

\* Note: Bootstrap is included if you would like to use it. However, it is possible to complete this assignment using pure CSS.

## To-Do (Look at that! To-Do List right here!)
- Create a user input box that tasks can be typed into.
- Add a submit button that appends the user's input to a list when clicked.
 **Bonus**
